Website Checker (Google Apps Script)
===================================

A lightweight website monitoring script that logs checks to a Google Sheet, surfaces a live Dashboard, and emails you when any URL fails.

The project is a single Google Apps Script (`code.js`) that you can attach to a spreadsheet. It periodically fetches one or more URLs, records status/latency/metadata, and maintains a simple operational dashboard.

Overview
--------

- Checks one or more URLs on a schedule (time‑based trigger)
- Follows redirects and records HTTP status and response time
- Extracts page title and meta description (for quick sanity checks)
- Records response payload size and resolves DNS A/AAAA via Google DoH
- Writes results to a `Checks` sheet with stable headers
- Builds a `Dashboard` sheet with KPIs and a failure feed
- Sends email alerts when a check fails (non‑2xx/3xx or thrown error)

Sheets Created
--------------

- `Checks` — Append‑only log with these columns:
  - A `Timestamp` (local tz), B `URL`, C `OK` (TRUE/FALSE), D `Status` (code),
    E `Final URL`, F `Response Time (ms)`, G `Payload (bytes)`,
    H `Title`, I `Meta Description`, J `Keyword`, K `Keyword Present`,
    L `DNS A`, M `DNS AAAA`, N `SSL Days Remaining` (placeholder), O `Error`.
- `Config` — Key/value config (see Configuration).
- `Dashboard` - Summary KPIs plus a "Recent Failures" table.

Quick Start
-----------

1) Create a new Apps Script project (or open the Script Editor from a Sheet).
2) Paste the contents of `code.js` into the project (File → New → Script file → replace).
3) Run `initialize()` once. This creates the spreadsheet, tabs, headers, and dashboard.
4) Open the created spreadsheet (URL is logged) and confirm tabs exist.
5) Run `runChecks()` to append a test set of rows.
6) Set a time‑based trigger (Triggers → Add Trigger):
   - Function: `runChecks`
   - Event source: Time‑driven
   - Type: Hour timer (for example, every 1 hour)

On first run, Apps Script will prompt for permissions (Spreadsheet, URL fetch, email).

Configuration
-------------

Open the `Config` tab and edit values in column B:

- `PAGES` — Comma‑separated list. Each item can be a full URL or a path relative to `SITE_BASE` (default `http://www.travelpets.com`). Examples:
  - `/` or `/status` or `http://example.com/health`.
- `KEYWORD` — Optional keyword to search for in page HTML (sets `Keyword Present`).
- `EMAILS` — Comma‑separated list of addresses to notify on failures.

The script persists the Spreadsheet ID in Script Properties so it can reopen the same sheet on subsequent runs.

Public Functions
----------------

- `initialize()` — One‑time setup. Creates sheets, headers, conditional formatting, default config, and the Dashboard.
- `runChecks()` — Performs checks for configured pages, appends rows to `Checks`, sends email for failures, and refreshes the Dashboard.
- `testSingleUrl()` — Fetches a single URL and logs the result to the console for quick manual testing.

Dashboard
---------

- KPIs (last 24h): total checks, failures, uptime, and average response time.
- Recent failures (last 20): timestamp, URL, status, and error message. The table lives under the KPIs on the left and shows "No failures" when none are present.

Notes
- The dashboard is rebuilt on each run via `ensureDashboard_()`.

Email Alerts
------------

When any check returns non‑OK (`ok !== true`) the script emails each address from `Config!B:B` (or your account email if empty). The message contains timestamp, URL, status, and the error (if present), plus a link to the spreadsheet.

Permissions & Quotas
--------------------

The script needs:
- Spreadsheet access (`SpreadsheetApp`)
- URL fetch (`UrlFetchApp`)
- Email send (`MailApp`)
- Properties (`PropertiesService`)

Apps Script applies daily quotas. If you scale checks significantly, consider spacing cron intervals or limiting URLs.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- Dashboard not updating:
  - Run `runChecks()` (or `initialize()`) to rebuild the sheet.
  - If KPIs look stale, wait a few seconds for formulas to calculate.
- No emails sent:
  - Confirm `EMAILS` contains valid addresses, or leave empty to send to your own account.
  - Check the `Error` column in `Checks` for clues.
- Timezone:
  - The sheet uses the script timezone (`initialize()` sets it). Adjust in Script Settings if desired.

Extending
---------

- Data retention: Add a scheduled cleanup to delete or archive rows older than a window (e.g., 24h, 7d). The Dashboard already looks back 24h, so long-term retention is optional.
- Archival: Move old rows to an `Archive` sheet before deleting to keep a long-running history without slowing the `Checks` tab.
- Rollups: Write one row per day with totals, failures, uptime, average and p95 response time for long-term trend charts.
- SSL expiry: Populate column N with days remaining for HTTPS endpoints.
- Alerting: Rate-limit alerts, require X consecutive failures before paging, or send to Slack/webhooks in addition to email.
- Reliability: Retries with backoff, per-URL timeouts, capture redirect chains.
- Extra checks: JSON/API assertions, keyword must/must-not match, HEAD vs GET.

SMS Alerts
----------

Two practical options to receive SMS when failures occur:

- Email-to-SMS gateway (quickest): Add your carrier address to `Config → EMAILS`.
  - AT&T: `1234567890@txt.att.net`
  - Verizon SMS: `1234567890@vtext.com` (160 chars)
  - Verizon MMS: `1234567890@vzwpix.com` (longer messages/links)
  - T‑Mobile: `1234567890@tmomail.net`
  - Google Fi: `1234567890@msg.fi.google.com`
  Notes: Messages are plain text and may be truncated; carriers may throttle bulk sends.

- Twilio (programmable SMS): Store `TWILIO_SID`, `TWILIO_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_FROM` in Script Properties and add a helper that posts to Twilio’s REST API. Call it alongside the existing email alert when failures occur.
  - Minimal helper (pseudo): `sendSmsTwilio_(to, body)` → `UrlFetchApp.fetch('https://api.twilio.com/.../Messages.json', { method: 'post', headers: { Authorization: 'Basic ' + Utilities.base64Encode(sid+':'+token) }, payload: { To: to, From: from, Body: body } })`.
  - Keep bodies short for readability on SMS.

If you want, I can add a `rebuildDashboard()` utility that refreshes formulas without clearing any custom formatting or notes on the Dashboard tab.
